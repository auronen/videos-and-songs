00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Alexey Lutsai: For many people, game ports are an anachronism from the early 00's. Surely you have tried projects ported from consoles to PCs, and it was

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:14,500
not too cool. Nowadays the term "multiplatform" is used more often. A game comes out everywhere at once. And thats it.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,500
But imagine one of the major native PC games, Gothic,

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,500
has just been ported to Nintendo Switch, and console players will finally be able to join in on the greatness. What's going on?

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Why and who needs it? How are games ported in general? Is a port always a literal port or does it sometimes extend the game itself?

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,500
Today we'll deal with it. I talked to the guys from the St. Petersburg studio Elverils, which deals with ports of games. For example,

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,500
Larian games on Mac and iPad. They've just released Baldur's Gate 3. Or you may know them from the iPad port of Original Sin 2.

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,500
They were originally the first open St. Petersburg office of Larian. They also make ports of Piranha Bytes games,

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,500
like Risen on Switch and Mac, Elex 2 on Mac. They were the ones who released the updated version of the first Gothic on Switch, which is what

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:07,500
we're gonna discuss. By the way, THQ has already announced a second part for Switch, and it's also being made by the guys at Elverils. If you like this

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,500
format, please be sure to give it a like, so I can keep it going.

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,500
Thank you in advance! One of the most common questions I get asked by subscribers when they meet me is "How do I get into game development?"

13
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:25,500
and what is the best field of study to choose. And here's how things are: artists, producers, musicians, even screenwriters

14
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,500
it's not hard to find, but game designers are rare. The industry is literally screaming about it in every interview and podcast. You may need

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,500
a dozen such specialists for a big project.  For example, combat system designer, minigame designer,

16
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,500
a level designer, a system designer who makes the rules in the game world work.  There's a lot to choose from, and

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,500
I would recommend learning at Contented in the "game designer" course. Because it's one of the biggest schools,

18
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,500
that teaches design in all its forms. The program includes more than 40 practical assignments so that you can immediately

19
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,500
apply your knowledge and build your portfolio. The outcome of the course is a project of your own game. The training will last 12

20
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,500
months, and at the end of the course you will be confident working with Unity, Unreal and Game Maker. You will master

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Unity Bolt, Blueprints, and Perforce visual programming tools that you need to build your prototypes.

22
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,500
You'll analyze the mechanics of your favorite games and discover them from a new perspective. There will also be three gamejams in the program,

23
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,500
so you can practice teamwork. Classes are 4 to 8 hours long

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,500
per week. If you don't have time for something, you can move the homework deadlines and even freeze the course so you can come back to it later.

25
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,500
The course is supervised by Kirill Zolovkin, a game designer with twenty years of experience. He has worked at Wargaming and My.Games. By the way, he recently had

26
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:46,500
a release of his game called "Gripper", which was recognized by Shuhei Yoshida, head of Sony's indie division. Your age and experience are not important, they will teach you everything

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,500
from scratch, and the career center will help you get a job or find freelance clients. Newcomers to the profession

28
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,500
earn from 80,000 rubles, and middles from 190,000. Contented students start

29
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:05,500
to work from the sixth month of school. And by the way, the school will give you a certificate on the basis of

30
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,500
State License 041164. And also, after registering for the course, you will get a training module on neural networks and access to a closed Telegram bot with 40 of their

31
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,500
varieties. You will understand Mid Journey, Pixel App and all kinds of Chat GPT that will help you in working on your

32
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,500
projects. So if you love games and are ready to get involved in an industry hungry for game designers, then sign up at the link

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Lutzai: What are some of the things that have changed that are visible at the 1st glance?

35
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Platon Fomichev: At the 1st glance - UI, of course. The map section appeared. Then we tried to revive some mechanics from Gothic.

36
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
In particular, I think, throwing items.

37
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,500
[Platon Fomichev. Elverils Technical Director] Well the music, yes, the music, the positional sound. Gothic was very famous for its exactly

38
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:00,500
positional sound, I mean, well music is okay, but then there was EAX. When we were making Gothic,

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:07,500
we were all very surprised at how positional sound is now dead as a class.

40
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,500
We did some reverb. It's off by default because

41
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:20,500
it wasn't to everyone's liking. We'll probably finish it some more. There's also reverb

42
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,500
in the game, so the game has a physical model of sound. It's trying to follow that

43
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:32,500
sound library that it had before. Yeah, the sound is completely rewritten as well, because the sound library

44
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:40,500
is long gone. The font. Yeah, the font's also changed. We made it so that it reads well on the screen both

45
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:50,500
when the Switch is in your hand and when the Switch is in the TV. Diego: "We'll meet in the Old Camp."

46
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Lutzai: Gothic is 20 years old now. There are a lot of archaic decisions in the game.

47
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:06,500
[Reinhard Pollice. THQ Nordic Product Director]. I tried the game and it feels like the console came out like 20 years ago.

48
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,500
That's a solution that older players will love.

49
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,500
But it seems like the younger guys won't understand. So what audience was the port of the game created for?

50
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Reinhard: the goal was to bring Gothic back to the people who remember it. Who

51
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,500
would like to play this deep RPG again, but in a handheld.

52
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,500
This is a game for those who prefer detailed simulation.

53
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,500
We never intended to make a modern version for the sake of hooking people who, for example,

54
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,500
playing Zelda or something like that on Switch. In many ways, these controls work better than the keyboard

55
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:53,500
and mouse on PC. Of course, we haven't done everything perfectly, but we'll try to fix that.

56
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,500
We know that Gothic has a large community, so our goal is to give them what they want.

57
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
Lutzai: A couple years ago in my video about Gothic

58
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,500
I said that it has such specific controls because it was originally designed for the gamepad.

59
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,500
And to be honest, I was a bit of a liar at the time. Indeed, there was such information on the Internet, but it was no

60
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,500
confirmation to this fact.

61
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,500
I say "fact", although I was basing it on my subjective impressions.

62
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,500
But here's what I learned from Gothic Classic's UX designer Konstantin.

63
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Lutzai: You know, despite the fact that in the video I said about the console control, I mean there was basically the feeling of fighting and a lot of things were

64
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:43,500
essentially done on the keyboard. And it felt like the gamepad would fit here perfectly. But lets say I said this back then

65
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,500
and found some confirmations in different sources. But I'm not 100 percent sure that's what it was.

66
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:58,500
[Konstantin Timofeev. UI/UX developer Elverils] Well I found in the code traces of what was being developed. There were such modules, there were such workarounds. Basically, I took some of it from there.

67
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Lutzai: Almost like a random guess, but it turns out there is such information.

68
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Konstantin: I really liked their original idea that they made all the controls in the game through action plus direction.

69
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,500
And I had a hypothesis that, yeah, we have a combat system based on this,

70
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:20,500
interaction, but they probably intended for there to be dialog on this

71
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,500
and some other features. So all the features were supposed to be on this. And when we had already opened the alpha builds, we looked at them,

72
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,500
and that hypothesis was confirmed. Because they have just down there on the bottom right, they've specifically showed Ctrl, Shift buttons,

73
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,500
the arrows and they'd sign what the actions on them should be done.

74
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,500
They literally had everything there following the same logic. What are these buttons? Why did they choose them?

75
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Yeah, it's really a console solution. This is us going back to the first gamepads,

76
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,500
where there were two buttons, jump, attack, cross.

77
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,500
By the way, as it was on the arcade machines. I mean it's absolutely such an old world idea.

78
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,500
But it's an idea that's unkillable. Because when we started doing Motion Control,

79
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:13,500
we found that it was a concept that was easy to put on it. Because Motion Control is just four directions,

80
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,500
that you use in the air. So you can press two buttons. We have an idea about

81
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,500
to make pure classic Gothic controls as an option. That's exactly the kind of "classic"

82
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Motion Control, that is, one Joy-Con, waving in the air, to get through the whole game.

83
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Interaction with inventory, in dialogs. Anything can be done.

84
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Lutzai: No, you heard the man right! They've really brought Joy-Con Motion Control into the port. Now it's practically a game for all type of players on Nintendo now.

85
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:51,500
[Gleb Shelkoudenko. Elverils Game Designer] I have a major question: why is there Motion in Gothic 1? Who came up with it? Who put that in?

86
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Gleb Shelkoudenko: Actually I still keep asking myself the same question. Because in general, it was a completely experimental initiative that our

87
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,500
programmer Alexander realized simply because he could. There was a willful decision to show this

88
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:10,500
to our chief on the publisher's side, and he liked it quite unexpectedly.

89
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,500
And he said: "you can make it a feature now." And we didn't breathe out

90
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,500
easily at all, because it was already a bit of a challenge.

91
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Lutzai: what can I do here with Motion? Gleb: Actually, all interaction with Motion's is limited only by the weapon. It is enough, basically,

92
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,500
I was initially very skeptical of the idea. When the goal was to get it to some sort of near playable state.

93
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:41,000
Simply because in my experience, I can't think of a single hardcore game where Motion controls

94
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:48,500
looked like a really relevant feature, rather than something like: let us just show you how our technology works.

95
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Lutzai: There's a gamepad, it's like it's always been there. And basically Motion probably

96
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,500
makes sense in this system where you do these swinging things around. But the only thing is that it's very conventional anyway.

97
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Gleb: It's interesting that when we started to test it in practice, it turned out that the dynamics of Gothic gameplay in general, and combat in particular,

98
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,500
it oddly enough, and in general, fits into this concept. And it even works in some places.

99
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
At least if you know exactly how it interacts.

100
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Lutzai: This Motion is specific too, as the normal controls here! Kind of hardcore. [Laughter] I can't hit it!

101
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
Глеб: Gleb: Basically, any even the most shitty implemented Motion can be simply... Lutzai: You try it.

102
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Gleb: justify that... Lutzai: The game is too hardcore. Gleb: Yeah, we've paid tribute to that.

103
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Lutzai: Yes, keeping continuity to the original gameplay and its unfriendliness.

104
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Lutzai: Did you modernize the combat in any way? Changed maybe the pace, the balance?

105
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Konstantin: We are working on the combat and we will continue to work on it. Right now we are working on the focus, so we have a normal

106
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,500
autofocus and targeting. Because players are complaining and basically we need to refine it.

107
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:00,500
We've done a mix of classic combat

108
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:07,500
and the modern one. That is, you can attack by clicking the enemy and, by pressing the action, you can fence.

109
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:13,500
We've made it so that you can both stagger and jump back. So we've split that moment.

110
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,500
It used to be kind of merged, meaning you could only jump back. The fencing mechanics is developed,

111
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:25,500
and it was even more developed in the alpha build. I, for example, have a dream of bringing back side tumbling from the alpha build.

112
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Now, people will probably say "well you're already making Dark Souls out of Gothic". But actually Gothic was like that from the beginning.

113
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,500
So the battles were dynamic and that's what it is now, these kind of left-to-right drifts,

114
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,500
these ridiculous steps - back then they were full-fledged rolls.

115
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:49,500
[Irina Starygina. QA-engineer at Elverils] The work on Gothic's controls was very curious and interesting. It took quite a good amount of time.

116
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,500
We've been surfing the fan sites for this game.

117
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:02,500
We collected comments, we analyzed it all. We made a test control system, we sent it to the Germans.

118
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,500
They looked at it, touched it with their hands, gave their opinion. After that, they

119
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,500
did a meeting of old players who like Gothic, and they'd listen to what they thought about the controls.

120
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,500
So we worked with all that feedback and tried to incorporate it.

121
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Луцай: And these "old-players" wanted the controls to be "old-like" too? Or what did they want?

122
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Irina: They wanted to keep the identity of the game.

123
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,500
I mean, if you love something, you don't like it to be twisted and completely turned into something else.

124
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:42,500
When we were discussing what kind of controls to do and what it should even look like, we had debates about how to fit this "forward and action" thing in.

125
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,500
I was talking about how the modern users shouldn't have to suffer so much, and how everything should be with one button.

126
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:54,500
We argued and argued, and then we thought there should be two control systems. So now you're playing the more modern version, like

127
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,500
a little bit simplified, which allows you to focus on the story.

128
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Lutzai: It's simplified, right? [Laughs] Okay, which one is more Hardcore then?

129
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Irina: In the original Gothic, we have three or four keys that you have to press to do one action. And I used to get very angry.

130
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Lutzai: So you had an impact on that? Irina: We have a team, we all give our opinion and everyone listens to it.

131
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Lutsai: How did they convey to you this task: "Make it so that the old guys like it anyway, and make it mean and hardcore, don't simplify it"?

132
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Gleb: It even came to such absurd situations, when the chief from the publishing house side says,

133
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,500
that you have to do it like this. "Like this" means literally as it was there 23 years ago.

134
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:41,500
I write him back with a two and a half page tirade of why it shouldn't be done that way, giving him 150 arguments why.

135
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,500
But in the end, he's like, "no." Okay, okay.

136
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
So we keep the [magic] wheel, we keep the three-button berry picking.

137
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Lutzai: So basically there was a temptation to kind of "improve the game"? I mean, to make it up to modern standards of some kind?

138
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Gleb: People probably don't like Gothic as much as they like who they were,

139
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,500
when they played the game. And what they encountered when they played it.

140
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Relying on some advice, recommendations, wishes in the major aspects without the presence of which

141
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Gothic turns into a literally different game - that's welcome, that's me all the time, but clinging to the

142
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,500
preserving every single minor feature, even if it frankly didn't work like much even then,

143
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,500
and even more so 20-odd years later. It's like it's not really rational, at least in my mind.

144
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Konstantin: UX of games went a little bit the other way. Overall, I don't see that the UX has gotten more user-friendly.

145
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,500
It's gotten more complicated because of this logical fragmentation.

146
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:53,500
So you're just shown some random button that's responsible for this. Another random button that's responsible for this.

147
00:14:53,500 --> 00:15:01,500
There's no logic. Often I don't get it, what did they actually base the logic of this arrangement of buttons on?

148
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,500
What did they want to get out of it? I mean, there's no complete picture.

149
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Gothic's approach was cleaner, more logical, and ingenious in that,

150
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:18,500
That you don't even have to memorize button names. You have the four directions. You always know about the four directions.

151
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:24,500
For example, you're interacting with some object. What would it mean "forward", better to say "upward"?

152
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,500
What would mean "backwards"? What would "left-right" mean? Your brain will tell you, it's pure association.

153
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:35,500
It doesn't have a name [The scheme says: "L + A - all interactions with the world!"]. You don't need to look at the legend to figure out which button is responsible for what.

154
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:42,500
And it's also different in different places for different things. Gothic didn't have any of that. You just click to interact,

155
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:49,500
and then you associatively choose forward, backward, left, right. Forward is something you have to do, apparently, to use.

156
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Back is something to undo, to throw away. Left to right is some options, meaning you're switching something.

157
00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Your brain is already telling you everything. But there's a high entry threshold there because it's not universally accepted. Here's the thing.

158
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:09,500
It's new at the time, and even now I would call it new. I mean, it's just not mainstream yet, and maybe it won't be.

159
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,500
But if it was, there wouldn't be all these problems of how to do this or how to do that.

160
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:26,500
As you may have noticed, I'm shooting in a new location. Yes, I've finally set up my own studio, where

161
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I don't interfere with anyone's life and work with my filming and streaming. But it takes a long time to decorate the studio and Im lazy to go somewhere

162
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:38,500
to shop. So I ordered a lot of stuff on Megamarket, because there's a cool one-click delivery option there.

163
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:46,500
For household appliances and electronics there's an awesome cashback up to 60% with bonuses from Sber "Spasibo".

164
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:51,500
I got myself two of these RGB lamps for atmosphere, a light filter on the lens,

165
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:58,500
some surge protectors, and an external 500GB SSD for the camera so that the footage can be written directly to it. And then of course,

166
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,500
I'm going to need a coffee machine again. It's not like I'm bringing mine from home. Anyway, the basket was

167
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,500
18709 rubles, and I'll get 2147 rubles back in cashback.

168
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:15,500
And this is, for example, a healthy pack of coffee for a month. And you can pay up to 99% with bonuses

169
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,500
of the purchase price. And if you order goods at Megamarket with SberPrime and SberPrime+ subscriptions, you will get

170
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,500
you'll get even more cashback. Shipping is free, by the way. And like I said, there's click-to-deliver. And what it is: ordering

171
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:34,500
will first be delivered to a Megamarket partner, and you get a notification. Then you call a courier, and he will deliver the order in a period of time from

172
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,500
15 minutes. And if it's the first time you're ordering something, enter my promo code "ОСЕНЬТЕХНИКА".

173
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,500
And get a discount of 3,000 rubles for an order of 10,000 rubles or more. In general, to

174
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,500
buy with comfort and profit go to my link in the description.

175
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Lutzai: Would you say that the version that you're working on now is

176
00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:00,500
an improved version of what it was, and it's a better state of Gothic than players once played it?

177
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Platon: There are a lot of people who watch modern media and who read forums. They like to say:

178
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:12,500
"They took a game from twenty years ago, ported it to Switch, no 60 fps, no raytracing,

179
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:20,500
no shadows. We have modders who can do everything better. What were they doing? It could have been done in, like, a month."

180
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,500
Well, that's completely untrue. Because people just don't represent,

181
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:31,500
what it is to really port a modern game. First of all, it's old code.

182
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:37,500
This is C++ code. It's great, it still works, but it's

183
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,500
was written for the 32-bit Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 platform. It's not a super secret. Basically, it's how it is.

184
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:50,500
And most of the old games were written for the old Visual Studio because it was a Windows project. And if it's

185
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:57,500
was a Windows project, then it was using Windows technology. And hardcore Windows technology. And the very first Windows

186
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,500
technology that you can call 0 is definitely DirectX technology. DirectX 6 or 7, I honestly don't rememeber right now.

187
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:10,500
But it's the DirectX Fix pipeline, so called. So there were no shaders back then. But there was a Fix pipeline,

188
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,500
which was fun, too. So what that means is that putting just Gothic on Switch

189
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,500
is impossible. It just won't run. Because Switch doesn't know anything about the Fix pipeline. It's had a shader

190
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:28,500
pipeline for a long time. This is where you have to, yeah, pay tribute to the German

191
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,500
punctuality. Here they had everything in the repository just like 20 years ago.

192
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Nothing was lost. Nothing was lost, no assets were lost, everything was in place.

193
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:45,500
So we took code that was almost a hundred years old and started working with it.

194
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Lutzai: Is this essentially reconstructing the game from scratch? Or a transfer of, shall we say, one environment to another?

195
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Plato: Let's put it this way. Everything that needed to be rejuvenated in terms of code is rejuvenated.

196
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,500
The game has been brought up to the latest C++ realities. Everything that needed to be rewritten in terms of graphics - rewritten.

197
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,500
So completely new rewritten. Everything else about the rest of it, which is

198
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,500
primarily scripts, gameplay. Well it is, of course, updated to the controller. Overall

199
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:23,500
the feeling of the world, the change of day and night, the weather, the behavior of NPCs - everything is left as it is.

200
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Lutzai: In general, it turns out that the Gothic we love came out not quite the way it was intended. The guys at Elverils for their

201
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:40,500
port studied the alpha build of the game and found a couple of interesting solutions that didn't make it to the release.

202
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,500
What else you think was cool in the alpha that didn't make it to the release game,

203
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,500
and you suddenly dug this up and you thought, "Wow! That's cool. It's a shame they didn't do that."

204
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Konstantin: I really liked the mechanics of throwing objects,

205
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,500
because it was originally designed for stealth. It was conceived of you throwing some kind of food to the beasts,

206
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:07,500
they react to it, they move out of the path, you go through. But the thing that struck me the most, of course, was when you kill some kind of

207
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:14,500
mob, you take its body, and you carry it to a much larger mob to distract it with that body. We have

208
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,500
an item throwing mechanic. It's about to come out with an update, but nothing changes from those item throws.

209
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,500
But in alpha it was one of those cool mechanics.

210
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,500
The best port is the one that adds something to the game so you know that, yes, there's your favorite game out there

211
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,500
on your favorite platform. But here's some features on the other platform that your original game didn't have.

212
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,500
And you're wondering what it would be like if I was going through with some new features.

213
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Well in this case, we have the opportunity to implement what Piranha Bytes wanted to implement, but they

214
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:54,500
didn't have enough time, for example. There's modifications, the famous zGamepad.

215
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Lutzai: Speaking of which, did you go to them, did you look into those modifications?

216
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Konstantin: Of course, yes. We looked at their modification first thing.

217
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Well, I can say that they have gone exactly the way of this modernization. Just like this, closer to the modern player.

218
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:16,500
But that would, in our case, in our task, break continuity with the original in terms of

219
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:23,500
the implementation of the action + direction mechanics. Their combat is done differently - it already violates this whole logic.

220
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,500
I'm on the contrary inclined to have more of these mechanics in the game. So that players get a sense of how flexible it is.

221
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Lutzai: In addition to the strange controls by today's standards, Gothic had a specific interface design that wasn't very comfortable.

222
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,500
It was decided to be reimagined from scratch. For example, there's a feature that may be sacrilegious to hardcore gamers

223
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:53,500
thing - a convenient menu of maps. Well, and in addition to that, a lot of things were redrawn under the new experience of use, which made the game more accessible.

224
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,500
For example, there is now a modernized equipment menu with a rubric. And it's easy to see what the hero is wearing.

225
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Plus a more or less convenient magic wheel.

226
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Why did you go for such a minimalistic UI style? I've heard the feedback, by the way.

227
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Some people said that it reminds me of MMO stuff like that. Although, on the other hand, I kind of understand that

228
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I mean, it's pretty much in keeping with the aesthetic. Somehow it even reminds me of Part 2's interface.

229
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,500
[Sofia Demina. UI/UX Elverils Artist] We chose the second part first, because of the commitment to the series and all that.

230
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Gothic is a very brutal game, again you can see that very well in the interface of the second part.

231
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:44,500
It's so brutal. It gives you exactly what you need, no more, no less. There was an idea to add a switcher

232
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:50,500
between the interfaces so that maybe somebody would want to go more minimalist, somebody would want to go more fantasy-like.

233
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Lutzai: How was the communication built? How do you get tasks set for you? And in what form do you bring them in?

234
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Sofia: I was doing different searches, experimenting with how I could present information to the player,

235
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:09,500
whether it suits the client. And generally doing research on the project, reading fan forums.

236
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:18,500
I've probably read everything there is to read. I watched videos, walkthroughs, I mean gameplay: what the player complains about, what they don't.

237
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Obviously, I was turning this on at X2 speed, but I had a pretty massive study like that in there.

238
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,500
More on fan patches and reviews of those fan patches.

239
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:35,500
It's not enough to do something from a fan, you also have to see how other fans reacted to it: they like it, they don't like it.

240
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Irina: There's another thing, you probably noticed. Lutzai: We have two weapons, two weapons to choose from,

241
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,500
before you could only have one. So that's kind of convenient, actually. Irina: Yeah, I mean we've always had the standard, this is the long-range and short-range

242
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:53,500
weapon. Now, if you like to swing swords, you can pick two cool blades of your favorite and carry them around.

243
00:24:53,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Lutzai: Didn't the guys mind that? Olds who wanted to keep that authenticity, some complexity.

244
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:09,500
Irina: Well, you can probably afford it, especially since we discuss, test and practice all these things.

245
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Lutzai: Tell me how you came up with the idea to make two weapons,

246
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,500
because it's really more convenient, it's what was missing, and it expands the tactical possibilities.

247
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Konstantin: It's just inconvenient when in the inventory there are some individual slots highlighted. You have to look

248
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,500
what you have selected, what you don't have selected. The equipment window was needed. And in that window,

249
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,500
we have one slot for melee combat and one for long-range. So this is the ranged slot, it's going to be

250
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:40,500
and it's gonna be in the hotbar, and it's gonna be in your eye all the time. So if you're not, let's say, an archer, a crossbowman,

251
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,500
you will always have an ampty slot. I thought it looks not so good.

252
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:52,500
That's when the thought was born: what if they were independent? It doesn't matter what you keep in that slot.

253
00:25:52,500 --> 00:26:00,500
So we finally implemented that, and it turned out to be really convenient. I've seen on streaming shows how a streamer approaches

254
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:07,500
to the stone golem. He pulls out his sword and then realizes what a mistake that was and remembers he still has his hammer.

255
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:13,500
He gets knocked back, he's got a little bit of health left. He quickly grabs the hammer from the second slot, starts fighting off the golem.

256
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:19,500
and defeats it. That's the game situation, I think it justifies the decision.

257
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Lutzai: And roughly how many iterations did your suggestions go through?

258
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Sofia: There were about 6 or 8 iterations. They were global rethinks of the interface. I wouldn't say they were super successful.

259
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:41,500
I like that we decided to mostly focus on the original because I like that hard brutality of the original.

260
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:48,500
But in our iterations, we've tried separating the information so that it's more easily presented, or let's say

261
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:56,500
could free up the middle of the screen. Some windows close it when there's no pause active in the game.

262
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Lutzai: Why did you decide not to keep the vertical interface?

263
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Sophia: Honestly, I love those bars in the inventory. I really wanted to keep them, but the client

264
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,500
but he would like the inventory to be like in Gothic 2. But the second Gothic is inconvenient

265
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,500
is that it's just a bunch of stuff. I mean, at least the first one is structured. So we combined

266
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,500
the structuring from the first one and this big inventory from the second one.

267
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:29,500
I was really afraid that the players wouldn't like this innovation, it seemed kind of wild to me.

268
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:35,500
Honestly? I didn't play Gothic when the time was right. There were other favorite games.

269
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:42,500
Maybe I'm just less familiar with it, but I thought this brutal limitation was kind of cool.

270
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:49,500
You're walking, and you have a bag. There are items in the bag, and you can't get to all of them at once. And it's like

271
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:56,500
limitation. You have to keep track of the management of the items: some to take away, some to leave, and so on.

272
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
I like that roughness.

273
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,500
Working with the fonts - that was certainly something creepy.

274
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Lutzai: Why? Were they somehow hard to get them out of there to rework?

275
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,500
Sofia: Well, how can I tell you... We have six, I think, languages in there to start with.

276
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Thank goodness I didn't have to work with characters for Chinese. So many characters in every language.

277
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:29,500
At the very least let's take English and Russian, that's already 60 pieces there, roughly speaking.

278
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:35,500
And every letter has to be drawn. You have to draw it so that it matches the other letters,

279
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:43,500
so that the text is more or less readable. And it's all quite a lot of complicated work,

280
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:51,500
especially since I don't have a specific background in fonts.

281
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Lutzai: Wait, and you know all these languages more or less or how are you familiar with them?

282
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Here's what I'm curious about. Since you've been reworking fonts, no?

283
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:06,500
Sophia: Roughly speaking, watching how it just looks in the draft and I've read articles on the subject,

284
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,500
and I found a couple books with all kinds of major core impressions.

285
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:18,500
The writing tradition for displaying a character is very important. It kind of defines how that

286
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:25,500
symbol will look like. The simplest example is the letter "N" in English and "И" in Russian.

287
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:31,500
If you just take the "N" and reflect it, it won't look like an "И" trivially because,

288
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:39,500
that there should be different thicknesses there. They were kind of spelled differently in their time. That's why we perceive it differently.

289
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,500
She looks like Ominous Valley, like a silly thing.

290
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Lutzai: Here's what I'm wondering. How many times do you have to go through a game to get it neatly ported to another platform?

291
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:54,500
In my mind, to rework the user experience and add some new features to such an ancient project

292
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:02,500
you have to take the game apart brick by brick, in reverse order. But is that really the case?

293
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:10,500
Did you go through the whole game with Motion? Who did you make do it? You know, so everybody could test it.

294
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Gleb: Irina did most of it. Yeah, she's probably already told you about her hard life.

295
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,500
No, no, no. She said to go to you and you tell me everything.

296
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:28,500
Do you actually have to go through the whole game like that to release a feature like that?

297
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,500
Gleb: In general yes. Well, at least spend a lot of time testing it at all stages of the game.

298
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:37,500
Because, clearly, the same set of movements, it's at different stages of the game, depending on the hero's pumping,

299
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,500
it's gonna feel very different.

300
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,500
Lutzai: Tell me, did you invent it or did you master it as well?

301
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,500
Gleb: Well it happened, in general, at the same time. We had several prototypes

302
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,500
of how it would be realized finally. And each time we implemented each one of them,

303
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:00,500
we've been doing some testing within our team, collecting feedback.

304
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,500
And then implemented changes based on that. I'm the kind of game designer who thinks that basically every single

305
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:14,500
developer should be a game designer to the best of their ability. So my work on the project in that regard

306
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,500
was more about getting people to cooperate with each other.

307
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:25,500
And just the fact that I probably have as much Gothic experience as all the other guys on our team combined.

308
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,500
In the last six months I've probably spent 200 hours in the first one alone.

309
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Irina: I haven't counted. It's definitely more than 100 times. Lutzai: Really?

310
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:38,500
Irina: Maybe even more than that. I mean when I'm testing I'm not playing the game,

311
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:46,500
and that's a little bit different. It's the other way around, I'm testing something, playing something, practicing something.

312
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,500
I already have some idea where it might break and I'm going through those places.

313
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:57,500
I feel like a detective trying to find the guilty person behind some kind of breakdown.

314
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:07,500
While testing Gothic, we got close. And we started making Gothic jokes. Lutzai: About Gomez, yeah, I heard that.

315
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Irina: There's a funny thing in the second one, when you drink the curse-removing potion,

316
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,500
and it says, "You feel relieved." Every time I go on vacation, I send that picture.

317
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Sophia: Honestly, I've only replayed Gothic once. Because I've watched quite a lot of

318
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:34,500
streams where someone's playing. So I was mostly focused on the interface there.

319
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:38,500
And I played myself to understand the player experience within the game.

320
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,500
Lutzai: I think it's hard to understand that from streams. Or am I wrong about that?

321
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Sofia: No, it's true. You're making all the right points. But I had Gothic as more than one project.

322
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:52,500
So I didn't have enough time for multiple playthroughs, but one was generally enough for me.

323
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,500
I think that's enough for me. Gothic isn't the smallest game after all.

324
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:03,500
And as you go through, you face challenges and understand the nuances of the controls.

325
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,500
[Eugene Grigorchuk. BG3 project manager on Mac] Lutzai: Wait a minute. So you were in charge of porting... Eugene Grigorchuk: Yeah.

326
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Lutzai: But you didn't play Baldur's Gate? Eugene: Not at all.

327
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Lutskai: How does it work? Eugene: It's very simple.

328
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Lutzai: So it's kind of unnecessary, right? Eugene: Yeah. So I haven't really played ELEX either. Here's the story I have.

329
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,500
I got through DOS 2, I think, until the first act. Then things got busy.

330
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Then I started working. And I actually have 780 hours of Divinity on my Steam profile.

331
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,500
It's one of my most played games. I don't know anything about it.

332
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:41,500
They tell me like this, roughly: there's a location, there's a problem on it, it needs to be fixed. I load the location and that's it.

333
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:47,500
Usually with quests, it's just you press a combination, roughly, of keys 1-3-4.

334
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:54,500
It starts a cutscene, the right cutscene. And this is a cutscene, let's say it has graphical artifacts, I do a captcha right away

335
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,500
and I start watching it. And that's it. I have no idea at all what...

336
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Lutzai: So those are basically a list, specifically these tasks with the moments where to look for them, you're already correcting them. Eugene: Yeah, yeah.

337
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Lutzai: And you're not very interested in these games yourself? Eugene: Baldur's Gate or all of them?

338
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,500
Lutsai: Well basically ELEX, Baldur's Gate, you know, what you're porting.

339
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Eugene: I think I've seen all the locations in Baldur's Gate. I think... I don't know, I've seen a million of them and somehow... I'm just getting bored with it.

340
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,500
Because you're with this 24-7 game. And you come home at night,

341
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,500
and you're like, "Man, I wish I had 10 more hours to look at the same thing."

342
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Lutzai: All right, come on, show some skill. You know these mechanics like the back of your hand.

343
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:45,500
Well you showed him, yeah. Very good.

344
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:55,500
No, that was impressive. All right, don't bother. Somebody's gonna do it for sure. On the mats, they're going to go through the...

345
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,500
Gleb: He'll thank you, yeah. Lutzai: Yes! That's actually a reason to do a challenge.

346
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,500
In the game:"Your blood! Don't do it again."

347
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Lutzai: What is the uniqueness of Gothic's design in your opinion?

348
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:14,500
Reinhard: We really put a lot of thought into it when we started working on the Gothic 1 Remake.

349
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:20,500
The game has a certain atmosphere because of the way the world and the characters are designed. And the main feature of the game

350
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:28,500
is that it doesn't manipulate you for the sake of keeping you, but it prioritizes player agentivity.

351
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:36,500
So the player's decisions matter. And he needs to interact with the world to make sense of what's going on.

352
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:43,500
The same thing applies to the simulation of a world where every NPC has their own routines and their own activities that

353
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:52,500
fill that world with life. I think that's one of the main reasons why these games were so popular and unique.

354
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:02,500
Lutzai: But where does the agentivity of Gothic come from? And the completely unconventional approach to even some of the

355
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:09,500
little things that make the game handle and feel differently than other games. You hear the phrase quite often nowadays,

356
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:15,500
that Unreal games feel the same. Or, "These guys should change their engine, otherwise their future games

357
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:20,500
will stop developing. And the heroes of this issue have an interesting point of view on this matter.

358
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Why, in these times of technical limitations, could they make such an elaborate one on different levels

359
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:33,500
game where a large number of all sorts of systems worked. Again, as you rightly said, a closed world, but

360
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,500
that felt alive. Why did something like that stop being done afterward? It's like there's no examples.

361
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Platon: I wonder about that myself. This is one of the topics that we often talk about with Mr. Reinhard.

362
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:51,500
How is it that here Gothic was able to do that? I know how Gothic works, I know what's in there,

363
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,500
like, 50% of the game is scripting, yeah. That's no secret either. 50% of the game is scripting in a very advanced language,

364
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,500
which, by the way, is the crown jewel of Gothic, no doubt about it.

365
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:09,500
The local scripting language, Dedaulus it's called. I believe the colleagues at Piranha Bytes

366
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,500
had a real epiphany. It was... well maybe it was from above, yeah.

367
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,500
How delicate the player was being led to some things: when he was looking for that crossbow,

368
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:27,500
a classic example from your own video, I think. That famous one with the Chromanin. Even when I was playing,

369
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:33,500
I felt like I was totally involved in the whole thing. And I guess the guys at that time were very good and

370
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:40,500
strongly thought it through. And also, probably, I think probably in those days people weren't afraid to say you have to do it this way.

371
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Like I want that when I'm running and there's a herd of wolves hovering behind me, all sheep

372
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,500
would run away and the NPCs with axes would lunge at the wolves. And the wolves would start running away,

373
00:37:53,500 --> 00:38:00,500
and they'd run into the houses and they'd attack the locals. And nobody ever said, "Oh, that's too hard,

374
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,500
You've got to build a neural network." Everybody just sat there and did it.

375
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:09,500
And sometimes using simple old methods. Roughly speaking, if a wolf sees a hut,

376
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:14,500
then run into the hut. There you go. Of course, Gothic can be breached, and there's no

377
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:20,500
super-praised AI inside. But the way the AI is done is still a head above,

378
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:27,500
than it is in today's reality. I think it's very useful for the younger generation to see,

379
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,500
an example of how the old Gothic works, how games can be made.

380
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,500
Konstantine: When I look at Gothic's code, I don't see anything complicated about it.

381
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Even later on, Piranha Bytes' code became more complicated, they became more professional, and this simplicity

382
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:51,500
has gone a little bit. I think it's such a unique moment when a new rock band is born and they have a

383
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:57,500
first album. They are so fresh, trying everything, interested in everything.

384
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:04,500
And in that moment, with literally simple tools, they create a masterpiece. It's the same here. Guys with ambition,

385
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:11,500
they didn't put any blocks, any limits on themselves. They just did whatever they wanted to do. Yeah, then the publisher put those restrictions,

386
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,500
and they had to cut something out. But the energy of this young rock band, you can feel it in Piranha. Even if we

387
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:23,500
look at some of their early pictures. It's just, I don't know, Metallica! They have such drive.

388
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:35,500
What's special about their engine is that the entire terrain is rendered polygonally.

389
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
This is not very good from an optimization point of view.

390
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:44,500
But in terms of the logic of the world, how they laid that logic down, it makes it feel of the world,

391
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:52,500
That it's really so composite. It's like a constructor is made. We can see that in the textures,

392
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,500
we can see it in the way the parts of the world are built in. The forests are quite elegantly done,

393
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:04,500
which are actually enclosed rooms. They're literally rooms that you walk into.

394
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,500
So they don't have anything mediocre. They have something that's all their own, unique, special.

395
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:14,500
They've left such courage in every decision they've made.

396
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Eugene: ELEX was written by about five people, as for the rendering, I think it was either five or three. And all the guys were

397
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:26,500
ultra smart. You can just see it in their code. You see the code, you see how it's written. You realize, if you want

398
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:33,500
to port this project, you can even not touch certain files at all. It's amazing. They're so

399
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:41,500
overflowing in their knowledge of writing code that they did a plus or minus perfect rendering, to be honest.

400
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Lutzai: Do you enjoy on the tasks themselves, the code itself? The way it's done? Evgeny: From the code itself, yes.

401
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:50,500
I spent most of ELEX'a in twenty files or so.

402
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:57,500
I kind of knew them by heart and so on. And that's basically how the rendering itself works, you know,

403
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,500
that it's pretty awesome.

404
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Lutzai: As you've realized, Piranha Bytes at one time tried to make everything from scratch,

405
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,500
without which we might not have gotten these unique games. But there's a downside.

406
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:16,500
Some projects from the noughties have been locked into specific platforms because of this approach, making the gaming experience

407
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:22,500
of console and PC players differed dramatically. Even that they couldn't get to know the classics

408
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:28,500
from a different platform. And even years later, this situation is not easily changeable. And some projects may not be able to

409
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
come back to life.

410
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:34,500
Does a game like this, even though it's on Switch, still need to be optimized?

411
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,500
Platon: Gothic is a very unoptimized game. It's a hell of an unoptimized game.

412
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:47,500
We've been thinking about this for a very long time. Gothic 1 on Switch the first day we launched it,

413
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,500
in the world it was nine frames per second. Nine frames because

414
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:59,500
of the CPU eating everything. If we compare the history of CPU growth,

415
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:04,500
their performance on a PC, we see that we had single-core configurations first,

416
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:11,500
that were going up in frequency very quickly. We'll remember these pentiums right here.

417
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,500
And if we look at the time when Gothic came out, it was the heyday of single core systems.

418
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:22,500
They had to have a lot of purity, they ran pretty fast. But the game was not multithreaded at all.

419
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:28,500
So it didn't talk about any multithreaded stuff at all, not at all.

420
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,500
Actually, Gothic is based on the Quake engine. A la Quake.

421
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:38,500
The game takes, it bites the triangles. In fact, the whole world is made of triangles in computer graphics.

422
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:44,500
It's nibbling on triangles that don't fit on the screen. And it goes through a giant tree quite quickly.

423
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,500
And the CPU has enough power to to get around all

424
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:55,500
these triangles fast that it throws at the video card. That approach is not applicable in a modern video card.

425
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,500
We can't throw a huge amount of geometry into the video card every frame.

426
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:06,500
It's just kind of outdated. And modern graphics cards are optimized for something else.

427
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,500
They're optimized that the geometry lies on top of them. We were shocked.

428
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:20,500
The game spent all its time doing tree avoidance, clipping triangles, working with AI and all that.

429
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:25,500
And naturally on that same thread, on that same process, she was loading its resources.

430
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:31,500
So the program was immediately clear - rewrite.

431
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,500
Rewrite and parallelize as many things as possible. First, understandably,

432
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:44,500
things that are obviously subject to parallelization are resource loading and sound.

433
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:53,500
Well then beyond that, so far we've been working on making the approach to rendering in Gothic really different.

434
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,500
[Rostislav Mikheev. Elverils Lead Graphics Engineer] So let's say you get your dose of some of that satisfaction when you are

435
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:04,500
solving these problems anyway. And you find a bunch of these bugs along with it.

436
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,500
You say, "Holy cow, how did people even manage to write this in their time?"

437
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:13,500
There's always some offsets in memory through manual calculations

438
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:19,500
of some magical numbers: something is adding up and trying to get somewhere. And you realize it's not going to be at all

439
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:26,500
work ever again. That's unrealistic on a CPU nowadays. So there's a thrill in it all.

440
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Lutzai: Did you remaster the soundtrack of the original Gothic? Did Kai Rosenkranz himself do that?

441
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:42,500
Reinhard: Kai Rosenkranz created the original soundtrack. He consulted with the developers of Gothic Classic, as the

442
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:49,500
technically the music and the soundtrack is done in a very strange way. It's different from other games that work with MP3 or WAV

443
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:57,500
files that are played in the background and then dynamically mixed with other files. There is no such synchronization here.

444
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:04,500
There's a melody and a score, and then the music is played on the fly by virtual instruments. And in the actual

445
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:10,500
original PC version of Gothic an outdated DirectX library called DirectX is used

446
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:18,500
This technology is a thing of the past. So we had to recreate a similar playback logic, and Kai played

447
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:24,500
a huge role in that. Making sure everything sounded right. We still have some problems with the technology.

448
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:33,500
For example, sometimes there are not smooth transitions. And yes, on top of that, Kai Rosenkranz is a member of the Alkimia Interactive team,

449
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,500
that's working on the Remake. So in all the trailers and stuff that we're releasing,

450
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:43,500
he's the driving force and the real maestro of sound that's doing all of this.

451
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,500
Platon: The structure of the music file, it's known.

452
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,500
We can clearly understand it, how the music file is structured.

453
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:01,500
Then the instruments from which the music of the Gothic itself is formed. We can isolate the instruments.

454
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:10,500
We can convert them into a format that we're comfortable with for Switch. We've done that. And then we need to do the synthesizer.

455
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,500
A little software synthesizer. It used to be very popular. The kind of music that plays in Gothic on Switch

456
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:21,500
is completely, completely different from the music that plays on Windows. Although it is similar, very similar,

457
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:25,500
because we've tried to make it as similar as possible. But there's still room for improvement.

458
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:34,500
Lutzai: As a player, this is a pretty frustrating topic for me. If you watched my video about sound in games, for example.

459
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:41,500
Thief series, you'll remember that I talked about using the same EAX technology that Platon mentioned in the beginning

460
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,500
of the video. There, it was used to navigate the level without a map or any locators. But unfortunately,

461
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:53,500
the development culture now is set up so that instead of preserving and developing the really cool technologies which

462
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:59,500
give a unique gaming experience, the industry is trying to optimize and cheapen the processes with unified

463
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:06,500
engines with off-the-shelf solutions. That's great, I guess. But you end up with an average toolkit because of which,

464
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:14,500
in my opinion, it's less and less likely that you're going to get a wow effect from games. And against that backdrop, ancient projects feel fresh.

465
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:20,500
Konstantin: Because technology is becoming unified, a different paradigm starts to prevail.

466
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:27,500
You don't need to do everything yourself. You just need to utilize what's available to everybody.

467
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:34,500
And you end up in a situation where you're trying to build something unique from a publicly available constructor.

468
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Yeah, the constructor can let you do some unique things, but that uniqueness is limited

469
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,500
not only by the constructor itself, but by the list of things that you can make with it.

470
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:49,500
We got into a sort of confined box where we explored everything pretty quickly.

471
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:55,500
It's still the same aquarium that you're put in and you can't go outside of it. And so when I, for example,

472
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:00,500
when I start Gothic, first of all, I have this amazing feeling that I'm not in this aquarium.

473
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:06,500
I'm somewhere outside. Creativity basically starts with a technical solution. The Piranhas had exactly that.

474
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:12,500
And I think that's the secret to success, that you're consistent not from some stage:

475
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:19,500
now I'm just going to take what I've got, and now I'm going to do something individual. But when you

476
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:26,500
individualized at all from the beginning. That's exactly the lost path that gamemade needs right now.

477
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:35,500
[Authors: Alexei Lutzai, Konstantin Timofeev. Editing, photography: Alexei Lutzai]

478
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,500
[Starfield post credits] Rostislav: it's a very interesting story. We once at one time,

479
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:46,500
in between, we worked with someone who was known in GPU circles, Wolfgang Engel.

480
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:54,500
GPU Gems he wrote books that just taught people how to write modern graphics.

481
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:00,500
Platon: For GPU programmers he is a god. Rostislav: Well, I guess so.

482
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,500
Here, and he was developing his own graphics solution. It was called The Forge. We worked with him once,

483
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:12,500
worked with him, and then we finished. We put a lot of stuff in there for Mac. Platon: And for Switch even. Rostislav: We were also putting something for Switch.

484
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:20,500
Wolfgang and I parted on some condition that we had some difficulties with time, and he was not happy with it.

485
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:29,500
And they made a game on it afterward, hack-n-slash. Plato: Hades. Rostislav: Hades, right. Platon: Thank you.

486
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:38,500
And then they did a render for No Man's Sky on it. And then they did a render for Starfield on it as well.

487
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,500
So the story is that yes, in Starfield and No Man's Sky there is

488
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:46,500
a graphical piece of The Forge that's actually the same render.

489
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:55,500
And there's still bits of our code in there somewhere. Platon: It's funny that Bethesda obviously didn't make a Mac version.

490
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:00,500
I opened No Man's Sky, and what did I find inside? My work that I was writing.

491
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Rostislav: Ah, yes, this one is a window creator. Lutzai: It's funny that Starfield gets blamed for this,

492
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:13,500
that No Man's Sky did pretty well. So they actually have more kinship than they might seem.

493
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:18,500
Rostislav: Well, assuming that No Man's Sky was on iOS or Mac,

494
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,500
But then it's kind of, as I understand it, they kind of absorbed it more there. But that's, unfortunately,

495
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,500
I can't say for sure anymore. But they have a certain kinship, sure.

496
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,500
Platon: Yes, it's funny, funny. Rostislav: That's the story.

497
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Simply because in my experience, I can't think of a single hardcore game where Motion controls
