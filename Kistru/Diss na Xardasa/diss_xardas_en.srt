1
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,610
 Xardas

2
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,210
Always this Xardas

3
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,410
We have something you cannot take from us

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,890
Some in robes

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,140
others in rags

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
There is one enemy -

7
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:20,920
that cursed necromancer

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:21,920
Xardas

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,560
Always this Xardas

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,200
Don't let yourself fall for this devil's tricks

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,190
I can depart

12
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:28,620
Teleportation

13
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,440
It will be best, if you disappear from the city

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,460
Xardas

15
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,990
Always this Xardas

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,720
We have something you cannot take from us

17
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,570
Some in robes

18
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,070
others in rags

19
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,100
There is one enemy -

20
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,880
that cursed necromancer

21
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,970
Xardas

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,450
Always this Xardas

23
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:47,000
Don't let yourself fall to this devils tricks

24
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,120
I can depart

25
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,560
Teleportation

26
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,210
It will be best, if you disappear from the city

27
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,830
At least for some time...

28
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:00,070
