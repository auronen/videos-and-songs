00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
I have a funny feeling that this stinking moron

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,400
have been adding gin to my beer every time.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,560
I think that the dirty skunk keeps the gin in this chest of his.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,860
Someone should replace the gin with water.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,540
Yeah, sure! No problem!

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,920
Welcome! I'm The Djinn from The Chest!

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,700
You know you can trust me.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,460
I have a power of immortality;

9
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,540
every man envies me.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,440
I'll give you a special offer,

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,280
but don't ask for anything more.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,320
I can fulfill three wishes.

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
What are your desires?

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
Would you like fame and money?

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,900
Power, castle, your own sun?

16
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,700
Golden armor and women?

17
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,640
A beautiful smile, two socks?

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,580
Would you like to visit The Monastery again?

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,460
A fast car or a tractor?

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,420
What is your wish?

21
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,220
Share your name with me!

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,280
Ooo!

23
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,260
Abuyin Ibn Djadir Ibn Omar Kalid...

24
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,780
Ooo!

25
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,080
(stuttered) Ben Ha-a-a-adji Al Sharidi.

26
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,800
Ooo!

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,680
My parents gave me this name.

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,400
Ooo!

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,600
A normal name as you can see.

30
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,220
Abuyin Ibn Djadir Ibn Omar Kalid...

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,920
Ben Ha-a-a-adji Al Sharidi.

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,040
My parents gave me this name.

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,500
A normal name as you can see.

34
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,940
So... um...

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,020
Well, alright!

36
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,740
My power is tremendous.

37
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,660
Every other djinn around me goes soft.

38
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,660
I can change urine into tea.

39
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,460
I like to drink it (tea) with my brother.

40
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,340
I will keep bringing you beer if you just ask me.

41
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,840
You have two wishes left. What are your desires?

42
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
Would you like fame and money?

43
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Power, castle, your own sun?

44
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,760
Golden armor and women?

45
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,480
A beautiful smile, two socks?

46
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,420
Would you like to visit The Monastery again?

47
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,240
A fast car or a tractor?

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,000
What is your wish?

49
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,280
Share your name with me!

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,720
Abuyin Ibn Djadir Omar Kalid...

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,620
Ben Ha-a-a-adji Al Sharidi.

52
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,700
My parents gave me this name.

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,200
A normal name as you can see.

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,080
Abuyin Ibn Djadir Ibn Omar Kalid...

55
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,000
Ben Ha-a-a-adji Al Sharidi.

56
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,880
My parents gave me this name.

57
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,760
A normal name as you can see.

58
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,180
Is something wrong with your ears,

59
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,220
or maybe you got completely sick of your life?!

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,240
Eh, whatever...

61
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,100
This is the last wish.

62
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,160
Someone should replace the gin with water.

63
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,240
I'll change you into a bottle of water!

64
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,620
