1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,160
Is it really true

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,540
That's no secret

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,220
What a bastard!

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,260
Get up, quickly, we have a problem

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,120
Seems like Dar was sniffing around here.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,840
Our packet of weed have vanished

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
searching everywhere and can't find it.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,540
He must've gone to the farm

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,380
maybe I'll find the package there.

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,080
This is my best weed

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,980
and I won't share it with Dar

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,340
We'll search the forests

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,640
we will search all the farms

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,040
We'll go to the castle

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,140
and to the Red Lantern

16
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,600
We will spend hours

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,900
searching the whole town

18
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,240
and If we'll have to

19
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,780
we will search even a monastery

20
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,940
Our stuff got stolen

21
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,580
tell me, where Dar could have hid it.

22
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,580
I am looking for a package

23
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,040
a tiny one and square-shaped

24
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,180
Perhaps I can help

25
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,920
if there's a reward in it for me.

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,820
Leave me alone

27
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,380
I'm having a headache all day.

28
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,460
Our stuff got stolen

29
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,140
tell me, where Dar could have hid it.

30
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,140
I am looking for a package

31
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,580
a tiny one and square-shaped

32
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,700
Even if I knew

33
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,440
I wouldn't say a word

34
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,340
I haven't heard

35
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,700
any rumors about it.

36
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,620
WHERE IS HE?!

37
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,020
We've searched the whole farm

38
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,840
all the floors, every corridor

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,680
No one has seen the mercenary

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,500
that have vanished with our package

41
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,340
We won't find anything here

42
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,180
it is time to leave this place

43
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,880
We must ask everyone

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,820
Dar couldn't have left the island

45
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,180
We'll search the forests

46
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,480
we will search all the farms

47
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,880
We will go to the castle

48
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,980
and to the Red Lantern

49
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:37,440
We will spend hours

50
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,740
searching the whole town

51
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,080
and If we'll have to

52
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,640
we will search even a monastery

53
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,720
Our stuff got stolen

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,420
tell me where Dar could have hid it

55
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,420
I am looking for a package

56
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,880
a tiny one and square-shaped

57
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,980
You were supposed to search for dragons

58
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,740
I don't know what you're still doing here

59
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,640
Don't disturb me

60
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,180
I must observe the orcs

61
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,300
Our stuff got stolen

62
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,980
tell me, where Dar could have hid it

63
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,980
I'm looking for a package

64
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,420
a tiny one and square shaped.

65
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,540
Isn't it that package

66
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,280
you were supposed to confiscate

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,340
Better tell me

68
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,440
if you have seen my liver

69
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,680
I'm almost certain, that it's here

70
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,080
my senses lead me here

71
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,280
a smell of swampweed can be felt

72
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,700
somewhere in this area

73
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,940
You still have one place to check

74
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,340
before the night will come

75
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,580
If you'll head down the road

76
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,220
you will find the mercenary

77
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,340
What are you going to do about the thief, then?

78
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,180
I'll catch him puffing away on my weed.

79
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,960
And then I'll find a quiet spot and teach him a lesson he won't forget.

80
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,820
What do you mean?

81
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,240
It's quite simple!

82
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,660
I'LL FLATTEN HIM!

83
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,960
Translation: Delph, GaroK

84
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,900
Translation: Delph, GaroK

85
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,640
Translation: Delph, GaroK

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,140
Translation: Delph, GaroK

87
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,280
So I've got you after ALL!
