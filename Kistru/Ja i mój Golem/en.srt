1
00:00:01,315 --> 00:00:04,000
You asked for it, scum!

2
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:10,857
You lost - deal with it!

3
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,787
First day someone already pissed in my chest

4
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:18,559
Two weeks ago some [...] stole my shoes

5
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:22,159
I looked for help, no mage heared me out

6
00:00:22,159 --> 00:00:25,904
But I still have hope, that I'll be okay here

7
00:00:28,644 --> 00:00:31,410
Igaraz with Agon - with them it's the worst

8
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:35,103
I'll say, I'd rather live with a shadowbeast

9
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:39,213
The bell is ringing, I'll come back to the story later

10
00:00:39,398 --> 00:00:42,549
I don't want to be late to the summoning class

11
00:00:58,896 --> 00:01:00,899
Me and my golem - the two of us

12
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:03,613
Nobody will bully me in the monastery anymore

13
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,340
He'll help me, when they stand in our way

14
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:08,321
Me and golem - the two of us

15
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:11,015
Because for me he's more than a monster

16
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:14,741
My choice, a friend, but summoned through a scroll

17
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,496
Me and my golem - the two of us

18
00:01:17,694 --> 00:01:20,164
Nobody will bully me in the monastery anymore

19
00:01:20,495 --> 00:01:22,932
He'll help me, when they stand in our way

20
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:24,913
Me and golem - the two of us

21
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:27,706
Because for me he's more than a monster

22
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:31,425
My choice, a friend, but summoned through a scroll

23
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:34,640
My and my go...blin skeleton - not for me

24
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:36,773
One shot puts down a wolf

25
00:01:36,925 --> 00:01:38,344
I have no other spells

26
00:01:38,437 --> 00:01:40,471
Noone has a golem scroll

27
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:42,000
Again I'm on the bottom

28
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:44,099
I don't have the strength for anything anymore

29
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,663
I don't know anymore, really

30
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:48,074
Although I have one thought in my head

31
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:53,930
Innos, eternal lord of light and fire.

32
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:55,108
Bles...

33
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:57,870
Hey, you! What are you looking for over there?!

34
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:15,917
Me and my golem - the two of us

35
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,588
Nobody will bully me in the monastery anymore

36
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,269
He'll help me, when they stand in our way

37
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,289
Me and golem - the two of us

38
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:26,037
Because for me he's more than a monster

39
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:29,763
My choice, a friend, but summoned through a scroll

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,465
Me and my golem - the two of us

41
00:02:32,643 --> 00:02:35,205
Nobody will bully me in the monastery anymore

42
00:02:35,417 --> 00:02:37,880
He'll help me, when they stand in our way

43
00:02:38,052 --> 00:02:39,867
Me and golem - the two of us

44
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,681
Because for me he's more than a monster

45
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:46,334
My choice, a friend, but summoned through a scroll

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
