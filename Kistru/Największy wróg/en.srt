1
00:00:01,526 --> 00:00:05,160
On the path of destiny I have beaten all the enemies

2
00:00:05,498 --> 00:00:08,910
I have gained fame and respect from the gods

3
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:12,427
They often call me the Dragon Slayer

4
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:16,000
I have banished The Sleeper everyone remembers that

5
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:19,766
But there is one figh, that I dream about every night

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,267
In the old fortress, the one with dark powers

7
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:26,734
the enemy there is more terrifying than Beliar

8
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:30,867
the damned Ladder, is the one that defeated me

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,534
This is the infernal image of death

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,467
I want to remove it from my memory

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,267
What happened? Did I fall?

12
00:00:36,334 --> 00:00:38,034
Soon I will fall into depression

13
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:39,860
A nightmarish depiction of misery

14
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,667
Soon you will taste my revenge

15
00:00:41,767 --> 00:00:43,500
Power of the fist, no mercy

16
00:00:43,534 --> 00:00:45,334
so I will beat the hell out of you

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,034
This is the infernal image of death

18
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,967
I want to remove it from my memory

19
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:50,800
What happened? Did I fall?

20
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:52,600
Soon I will fall into depression

21
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,367
it's a nightmarish depiction of misery

22
00:00:54,434 --> 00:00:56,227

Power of the fist, no mercy

24
00:00:58,067 --> 00:00:59,867
so I will beat the hell out of you

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,574
No! By Innos! I sense a presence of a dark being, something very evil. A grim force flows through the whole valley.

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,377
I have met the Ladder. I'm afraid I am going to die imminently.

27
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:16,100
This is your greatest enemy

28
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:18,453
Because of whom you fall from the top to the bottom

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,767
Your greatest enemy

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,080
You may start digging your grave right away

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,434
Your greatest enemy

32
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,767
Because of whom you fall from the top again

33
00:01:25,867 --> 00:01:27,067
Your greatest enemy

34
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:29,300
This game is one hell of a BUG!

35
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:32,500
This is the infernal image of death

36
00:01:32,567 --> 00:01:34,467
