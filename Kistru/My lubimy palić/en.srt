00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,700
I knew a guy once

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,200
Onar was his name

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,800
Old, he was - and dangerous,

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,820
always had a worried face

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,460
He found some weed in the clothing chest

6
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,200
After he had smoked it, he started dancing with the villagers

7
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,860
In swampweed there is enchanted power,

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,440

00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,870

We like to smoke, because it give us power

I want one puff, I'm not asking for much more!

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,730
Do you know what's green, small and grows on the swamp?

14
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,480

You probably know Rosi,

20
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,850
It's Sekob's wife

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,860
She constantly complains that her leg hurts a lot

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,140
She started smoking weed,

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,590
this is the fourth pack already

24
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,550
She got so stoned, she started doing flips off the roof

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,990

Aswell as Haze for making a great thumbnail
