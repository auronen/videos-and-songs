1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,820
Once a great warrior, now you're siting tied up

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,620
You were a hero here, known by everybody

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,160
We have the power now, but we won't set you free.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,380
You may try to escape but you will be hacked to pieces.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,800
Onion oath, Onion vengeance

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,700
No one will remember you after your death.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,600
Onion power, onion vengeance

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,280
After few minutes, only a legend shall remain.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,400
You were chopping us, now we will chop you

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,220
I'll ensure there are no funeral witnesses

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,680
You may be afraid now, get ready for suffering

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,860
Even the "Heal Rune" will not help you.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,500
You were chopping us, now we will chop you

14
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,460
I'll ensure there are no funeral witnesses

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,000
You may fear now, get ready for suffering

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,000
Even the "Heal Rune" will not help you

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,420
Suddenly darkness everywhere,

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,440
You see, stupid onions

19
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,300
Stop! Hold it right there, or I'll murder all!

20
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,200
No problem. I'm going to enjoy this

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,080
Remember one thing, my sign is namelessness

22
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,580
You may run, but you won't escape me.

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,080
You may stand, then death will come sooner.

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,480
You may scream, but anybody won't hear you..

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,980
You may be silent and die in the embrace of silence.

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,100
You were chopping us, now we will chop you

27
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:42,580
I'll ensure there are no funeral witnesses

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,640
You may fear now, get ready for suffering

29
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,620
Even the "Heal Rune" will not help you

30
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,180
You were chopping us, now we will chop you

31
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,160
I'll ensure there are no funeral witnesses

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,860
You may fear now, get ready for suffering

33
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,880
Even the "Heal Rune" will not help you

34
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:43,610
