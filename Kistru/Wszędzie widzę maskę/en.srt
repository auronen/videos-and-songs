00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,380
Coming back with a letter from Garond

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,190
I intend to finish the second chapter

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,200
So far the area seemed pretty peaceful

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,990
Not mentioning those orcs

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,000
the ones I saw walking near Cavalorn's hut

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,940
In the distance there's some character

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,020
It's unsettling that I don't see the face of the gentleman

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,220
I feel...

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,840
Ohhh, man...

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,730
I feel his stare on me

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,170
eyes red like a flame

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,710
I don't know his intentions

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,159
What could he want from me?

14
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,650
I'd rather not provoke him

15
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,040
My head is starting to hurt

16
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,600
I keep having hallucinations

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,840
Everywhere I see his mask

18
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,780
I feel fear when I look at it

19
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,550
Everytime it's even scarier

20
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,700
Now I'm seeing it again

21
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,390
In the city, on the farm

22
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,580
He keeps staring at me

23
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,290
And follows me around like a partner

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,320
but it's still an enemy

25
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,040
I see my own reflection in him

26
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,960
but only black magic

27
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,990
Darkness decorates his robe

28
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,020
I'd rather not follow his tracks

29
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,770
I have enough of this suffering

30
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,770
Why are you turning me into a monster?

31
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,720
As if I had not enough worries

32
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,350
I need to finally learn the truth

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,790
take that cursed mask off

34
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,230
I feel his stare on me

35
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,830
eyes red just like a flame

36
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,230
I don't know his intentions

37
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,660
What could he want from me?

38
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,150
I'd rather not provoke him

39
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,560
My head is starting to hurt

40
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:35,160
I keep having hallucinations

41
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,450
Everywhere I see his mask

42
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,280
I feel fear when I look at it

43
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,130
Everytime its even scarier

44
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,240
Now I'm seeing it again

45
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,190
In the city, or the farm

46
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,990
He keeps staring at me

47
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,730
and follows me just like a partner

48
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,750
but it's still an enemy

49
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,610
Take this cursed mask off

50
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,870
She hides under a robe

51
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,700
Everyone would want such a chick

52
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,500
Additionally, she also likes magic

53
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,620
knows maybe 100 spells

54
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,620
Maybe I can work for her?

55
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
I'd like to be a Seeker

56
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,180
and I don't know how I'll explain myself

57
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,190
I want to be only with her

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
